# This project is a simulation for an operating system's
# scheduler and memory allocation.
# The scheduler contains 4 different algorithms:
# 1.Shortest Job First
# 2.Preemtive Highest Priority First
# 3.Round Robin
# 4.Preemptive multilevel feedback queue

# The memory allocation was implemented using buddy system 
# and is respresented as a tree.

# This project was a part of an Operating System course 
# in the Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering
